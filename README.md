# Sudoku-Code

## Description

Herein lies code I wrote circa 2015 to as robustly as possible be able to generate, analyze, solve, view, filter, etc. Sudoku puzzles. 

In the "filter software" folder is a Windows Forms Application solution for an app that reads a file of codified Sudoku puzzles and allows user input to filter by various techniques needed to solve the puzzles, an overall programmatically decided difficulty level, and other parameters.

The "generation software" folder contains a different WFA solution for an app that can be used to create and manually solve a single puzzle at a time, or generate them en masse (for later filtering with the former app).

I created these applications in part for the fun of the challenge itself, in part to generate sudokus for myself including some of different sizes (4x4 and 16x16), and in part with the potential in mind to later create an application or book of sudoku puzzles that I could inject large puzzle data into. While I did so with this code, I did create and publish a book of alternate-sudoku puzzles via a similar project, viewable here: https://github.com/hornickjohn/sudokunos
